## UI

### Features
The webpage has the following features:
<!-- 
- The home page layout displays the image of the restaurant in a structured and standardized format with essential information within one glance. 
- Only key information is reflected to prevent overcrowding of the home page. 
- Information can be easily retrieved by clicking on the image of the restaurant or the “View More” button. 
- Upon hovering of the mouse over the logo, the logo will be highlighted. 
    - Blue is used as a neutral colour to indicate update. 
    - Red is used for delete to ensure that users do not click on the button. 
    - Green is used for addititional information.
    - Dark grey is to indicate navigating backwards.
- Consistent background  across all the webpages. -->

### Future Features

* HTML 5
* CSS 
* JavaScript 
* Bootstrap v4.4 toolkit to organize the elements in the page
* jQuery library for DOM manipulation
* Python 
* Flask
* Gitpod for the writing of codes and testing of website
* Mongodb Atlas for the hosting of database
* W3C Markup Validation Service for HTML and CSS validation
* GitHub
* Cloudinary image hosting

## Database
- DB selected because of:
- The database is hosted and stored postgres
- `Database design`

## Testing
The website has been tested for viewing and responsiveness on various screen sizes, including but not limited to the following web browsers and devices:

* Apple Safari Web Browser
    1. macOS 
    2. Windows 10
    3. iOS
    4. iPadOS
* Mozilla Firefox Web Browser
    1. macOS

    3. Android 10
* Google Chrome Web Browser
    1. macOS
    2. Windows 10
    3. Android 10

- HTML, CSS validated by W3C Markup Validation
- JavaScript Syntax validated by Esprima

1. Testing was first done by applying CRUD to `items` the built web interface. Upon successful CRUD operations and image uploading, the hosted webpage is then provided to random testers to test out the CRUD operations and UX and their feedback is taken into consideration.
2. After the testing is done, additional features are added based on priority versus estimated time required to implement, remaining features will be added in the future. 
3. The web application is then tested on various web browsers and device screens for compatibility purposes.
4. The edited final web application is then updated onto the host server

## Deployment
The website is deployed on Heroku, using GitHub to host the project repository. The website can be found at this [link](http://foodiereview.herokuapp.com).
- Database passwords and session keys are stored in the .env file which is included in the .gitignore.
`steps taken to deploy`
